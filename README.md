# AI Sponge Lite

## About

AI Sponge Lite is a self-hosted Discord bot that generates parody AI Sponge audio episodes, TTS, and chats inspired by
[AI Sponge Rehydrated](https://aisponge.riskivr.com/).

### Characters

SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Gary, Mrs. Puff, Larry, Squilliam, Karen, Narrator,
Bubble Buddy, Bubble Bass, Perch, Pearl, DoodleBob, Mr. Fish, Flying Dutchman, King Neptune, Man Ray, and Dirty Bubble.

## Usage

- `/episode`: Generate an audio-only episode. This will create a full episode with multiple characters, sound effects,
  and background music.
- `/tts`: Make a character speak text. You can also apply various audio effects to the generated speech based on the
  effects available in episodes.
- `/chat`: Chat with a character. History is not remembered, so each message is independent. Your display name is
  inserted into the prompt so the character can address you.
